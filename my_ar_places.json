Housed in a building built in 1895, which has always been occupied by cabarets or nude dancers' bars since its erection, the Café Cléopâtre has been part of the Montreal landscape since 1970.  Located in the heart of the old Red Light, this emblematic cabaret proudly embraces the historical heritage of this neighbourhood by offering burlesque evenings whose eroticism and tone are reminiscent of the hot Montreal nights of the 1920s.  However, despite its popularity among both the heterosexual and LGBTQ+ communities, this Montreal institution has had to resist several attempts to expropriate it throughout its history.  In fact, as early as 2009, when the Quartier des Spectacles was created, the Angus Development Corporation, which was partly responsible for the redevelopment of the neighbourhood, made several offers to the owner of Café Cléopâtre to take possession of its premises.  However, after a highly publicized saga that lasted more than two years, the Café Cléopâtre finally won out over the real estate developers who wanted to replace this century-old building with a twelve-storey building that would have been occupied by offices and businesses.  However, the Café Cléopâtre's victory did not prevent the Quartier des Spectacles project from coming into being. This new central district of Montreal's cultural scene, the heir to the Red Light, has a red circle as its logo, reminiscent of the name that this sector of Montreal once bore.",

Located in the heart of the old Red Light, this emblematic cabaret proudly embraces the historical heritage of this neighbourhood by offering burlesque evenings whose eroticism and tone are reminiscent of the hot Montreal nights of the 1920s.  However, despite its popularity among both the heterosexual and LGBTQ+ communities, this Montreal institution has had to resist several attempts to expropriate it throughout its history.  In fact, as early as 2009, when the Quartier des Spectacles was created, the Angus Development Corporation, which was partly responsible for the redevelopment of the neighbourhood, made several offers to the owner of Café Cléopâtre to take possession of its premises.  However, after a highly publicized saga that lasted more than two years, the Café Cléopâtre finally won out over the real estate developers who wanted to replace this century-old building with a twelve-storey building that would have been occupied by offices and businesses.  However, the Café Cléopâtre's victory did not prevent the Quartier des Spectacles project from coming into being. This new central district of Montreal's cultural scene, the heir to the Red Light, has a red circle as its logo, reminiscent of the name that this sector of Montreal once bore.",
